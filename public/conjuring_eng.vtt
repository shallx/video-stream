<font color="#808080">DEBBIE:</font> It scares us
just thinking about it.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.762
When you hear it, you're gonna
think we 're insane.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.611

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.886
<font color="#808080">DEBBIE:</font> It started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.566
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.769
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.490
It was moving around by itself.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.804
<font color="#808080">ED:</font> Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.644
<font color="#808080">DEBBIE:</font> That's exactly what we thought.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.805
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.725

that the doll was possessed?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.291
Yes.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.161
Camilla got in touch with a medium. We
learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.244
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.121
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.643
All she wanted was to be friends.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.167
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.011
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.486
So...

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.126
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.282
<font color="#808080">ED:</font> Wait, you did what?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.081
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.446
We said yes.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.001

It's something inhuman.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.841
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.162
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.091
You gave it permission

What's an inhuman spirit?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.527
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.809
It's something demonic.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.768
<font color="#808080">DEBBIE:</font> So the doll was never possessed?

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.849
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.361
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.206
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.442

It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.643
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.247
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.290
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.889
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.281
Infestation, oppression and possession.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.805
Now, infestation:

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.931
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.761
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.207
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.249
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.290
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.887
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:06.291
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.010
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.606
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.807
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.450
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.681
How can we help you?

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.164
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.283
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.205
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.250
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation...

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.167
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.166
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.527
Please can you come and take a look?

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.246
Of course we will.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.610

Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

as an insult to the Trinity:

Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

That's what I was talking about.

It was here when we moved in.

we'd move to, you know?

take in a family of seven indefinitely.

All right, let's get started.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.167
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.362
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.730
...who, with her family, has been

I guess it was the clocks.

- But he's always sad.

Why is that?

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.040

something bad happened to him.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.001

you know, we never knew who lived here.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.371
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.846
An exorcism.

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.885
What, exorcism?

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.810
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.365
<font color="#808080">LORRAINE:</font> No, not necessarily, no.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.331

I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

Go ahead, hon.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.725
...and your land.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.767
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.127
It was latched to your back.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.690
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.887
And it doesn't matter where you go...

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.209
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.885
...and it's feeding off you.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.088
Even if we leave?

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.925
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.369
You take it with you.

you have a lot of spirits in here...

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.288
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.010
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.491
<font color="#808080">ED:</font> I wish it were that easy.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.645
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:52.570
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.241
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.643
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.330
...and that's the hard part.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.209
Have your children been baptized?

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.684
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.527
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.806
Why?

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.325
Because we're a threat.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.410
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:24.121
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.210
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.169

From the first occurrence.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.486
Nothing.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.241
The whole time.

00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.966
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.570
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.763
That's the original farmhouse.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.003
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.766
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.203
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.561
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.603
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.650
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.649
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.730
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.962
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.282
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.331
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.767
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.884
Well, that explains a few things.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.769
Yeah, so does this.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.809
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.290
Sounds good.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.126
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.442
Heh. Nice timing.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:09.726
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:12.406
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.641
Really?
